  bio: >- # tell to the world

    <p>I am currently a second-year Computer Science PhD student at Cornell University, advised by Professors Fei Wang and Kyra Gan. My research is centered on healthcare and causal inference, with the goal of developing ML methods to assist in designing eligibility criteria for clinical trials.<br><br>

    Before pivoting to computer science, I built a diverse academic foundation in biomedical informatics, spanning transcriptomics, database and web development, oncoimmunology, clinical informatics, and machine learning. This background allows me to approach healthcare challenges with the analytical 
    rigor of a computer scientist while retaining the biological intuition of a researcher deeply immersed in the life sciences. <br><br>

    Prior to joining Cornell, I earned my Master's degree in Biomedical Informatics from Harvard Medical School, where I had the privilege of working under the mentorship of Dr. Yevgeniy Semenov. 
    I completed my undergraduate studies in Biotechnology at Sun Yat-sen University, under the guidance of Dr. Lingling Zheng. Additionally, I have gained practical experience during my time at 
    Massachusetts General Brigham, where I applied my insights on EHR data quality to development of data quality control tools for the ENACT Network.<br><br>
